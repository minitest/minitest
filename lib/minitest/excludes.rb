##
# minitest/excludes.rb extends MiniTest::Unit::TestCase to provide a
# clean API for excluding certain tests you don't want to run under
# certain conditions.
#
# For example, in test/test_xyz.rb you have:
#
#   class TestXYZ < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
#     def test_good
#       # test that passes
#     end
#
#     def test_bad
#       # test that fails only on jruby
#     end
#   end
#
# For jruby runs, you can add test/excludes/TestXYZ.rb with:
#
#   exclude :test_bad, "Uses ObjectSpace" if jruby?
#
# The file is instance_eval'd on TestXYZ so you can call the exclude
# class method directly. Since it is ruby you can provide any sort
# of conditions you want to figure out if your tests should be
# excluded.
#
# TestCase.exclude causes test methods to call skip with the reason
# you provide. If you run your tests in verbose mode, you'll see a
# full report of the tests you've excluded.
#
# If you want to change where the exclude files are located, you can
# set the EXCLUDE_DIR environment variable.
